# Resolve and ensure the working-tree directory SDD uses for one plan's
# short-lived artifacts: task briefs, implementer reports, review packages,
# and the progress ledger. Print the plan directory's absolute path.
#
# One directory per plan (.agent-sync/sdd/<plan-basename>/) so a follow-up
# plan in the same working tree can never read or overwrite another plan's
# artifacts. A stale ledger misread as current progress makes controllers
# skip whole task sequences — plan-scoping removes that failure structurally.
#
# Basename slugs collide when two plans share a filename (docs/alpha/plan.md
# vs docs/beta/plan.md), so each workspace records its owning plan's path in
# a plan-path marker (repo-relative in-repo, absolute outside). A workspace
# owned by a different plan is skipped and the slug disambiguated with the
# plan's parent-directory name, then a counter. A workspace with no marker
# predates the marker scheme and is adopted for the current plan so in-flight
# workspaces keep resolving — which means the first collision on such a
# legacy workspace adopts instead of detecting; acceptable, marker-less
# workspaces age out as plans finish.
#
# The repository root is resolved from the PLAN's directory, not the caller's
# cwd, so running from another directory can never write .agent-sync/ into an
# unrelated repository.
#
# The workspace lives in the working tree (not under .git/) because Claude Code
# treats .git/ as a protected path and denies agent writes there — which blocks
# an implementer subagent from writing its report file. A self-ignoring
# .gitignore at .agent-sync/sdd/ keeps every plan's workspace out of
# `git status` and out of accidental commits without modifying any tracked file.
#
# Single source of truth for the workspace location, so task-brief and
# review-package cannot drift to different directories.
