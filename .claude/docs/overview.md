## What A Team is

A Team is a **portable multi-agent infrastructure** for AI coding assistants. It works with any model — Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, or others — through any supported platform. It turns a single general-purpose model into a coordinated team of specialists — each with a defined role, tool access, and quality gate — that enforces the same engineering standards on every project it's deployed to.

```
Without A Team                        With A Team
─────────────────────────────────     ─────────────────────────────────────
One model                             17 specialist agents (pruned for this repo)
Does everything                       Each has one responsibility
No enforcement                        Hard gates that can't be bypassed
Forgets standards between sessions    Standards re-injected every session
Manual routing                        Orchestrator dispatches automatically
No audit trail                        DAILY.md + Veto Buffer + AUDIT.md

## The Daily Cycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor H as Human
    participant O as Orchestrator
    participant A as Agents
    participant V as Veto Buffer

    Note over H,V: Every morning
    H->>O: /orchestrate morning
    O->>O: Read TASKS.md + ROUTING.md
    O->>O: Check for ambiguous tasks → AMB-NNN
    O->>H: Present plan + AMB items
    H->>O: Approve (with AMB decisions)

    Note over H,V: Work in progress
    O->>A: Dispatch wave 1 (parallel, no depends_on)
    A->>A: Work in isolated worktrees
    A->>O: Result + decisions_made
    O->>V: Log ambiguous decisions (DEC-NNN)
    O->>A: Dispatch wave 2 (unblocked tasks)

    Note over H,V: Pre-merge
    O->>A: harness-optimizer (pipeline audit)
    A->>O: AUDIT.md verdict
    O->>A: Parallel quality-gate reviews
    A->>O: All PASS
    H->>O: Approve merge

    Note over H,V: End of day
    H->>O: /orchestrate report
    O->>H: Evening telemetry + Veto Buffer review

## Installation — 3 Steps

```bash
# 1. Copy infrastructure into your project
cp -r "A Team/.claude"  your-project/
cp -r "A Team/skills"   your-project/
cp -r "A Team/hooks"    your-project/

# 2. Declare your project scope
cp "A Team/INIT_TEMPLATE.md" your-project/INIT.md
# edit INIT.md — languages, stack, compliance scope, CLI(s)

# 3. Initialize — orchestrator prunes irrelevant agents automatically
/orchestrate init
```

After init: `.agent-sync/TEAM.md` lists what's active. Everything else is pruned.

## Key Design Principles

| Principle | How A Team implements it |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Stateless** | Every agent reads from files; no memory between sessions |
| **Prunable** | Orchestrator removes irrelevant agents at init; lean by default |
| **Portable** | Works on Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode — same files |
| **Enforceable** | Hard gates via hooks; skills injected every session |
| **Auditable** | DAILY.md, Veto Buffer, AUDIT.md — full trail of decisions |
| **Surgical** | Every agent has a single responsibility; no scope creep |
| **Parallel** | Independent tasks dispatched simultaneously; worktrees prevent collision |

refactor-cleaner

e2e-runner
typescript-reviewer   ←── kept (React SPA)
python-reviewer       ←── kept, scoped (.github/skills, analysis/ only)
infra-reviewer        ←── kept, CI/CD scope only (.github/workflows)
compliance-reviewer   ←── kept, WCAG 2.2 AA scope only
performance-profiler  ←── kept, low priority (no perf budget declared)
```

The team that runs is the team the project needs. Nothing more.
